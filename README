Kubernetes Python Client Time-Based Scaling App

Summary: 
This app is a small Python program that makes use of the official client library for Kubernetes to scale the deployment of the 
commerce-nginx application. It runs within a docker container based off the latest official Python image and Kubernetes 
client library. I have pushed this image to a public repo on my dockerhub (akaja/commerce-scaler:0.0.1) for easy deployment via "kubectl run".
Alternatively, it can be installed using the included helm chart in the \commerce_deliver\scaler\helm\ directory.

Requirements:
name must be "commerce-nginx"
namespace must be "default"
Kubernetes Service Account with access rules:
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["deployments"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"]
